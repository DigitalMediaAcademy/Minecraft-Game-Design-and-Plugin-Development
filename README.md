##Course assets
###Minecraft_starting_assets
A folder that students should use to start their projects in. It contains a few example adventure maps, example resource packs, a default resource pack, an unbuilt spigot server, and plugins needed for that server. These will likely need to be updated in future weeks.

###Minecraft_finished_assets
A copleted build of a Spigot server, and a scriptcraft server, and the same examples. Will be updated with student examples.

###minecraft.zip
A minecraft installation with blank user profiles and the example maps and packs preinstalled. Place this in your `Library > Application Support` and replace the current minecraft folder, after compressing it to back it up.
